Framing the Problem
Capitalism at a Crossroads
The top 1% in the UK owns more wealth than the bottom 70%. With Government budgets stretched—£24 billion annually on
  adult social care—society’s challenges can’t be solved by taxation alone. ESG frameworks often fall short, enabling
  ‘greenwashing’ over real impact. It’s time for businesses to take the lead and drive meaningful change.

Mission & Goals
Our Ambition: The PhilCo 1000
We aim to enroll 1,000 businesses that commit at least 10% of their shares to charitable foundations. This initiative
  will build a better future for business and society, fostering growth, resilience, and long-term value for both
  communities and organisations alike. Join us in creating meaningful change.

Why Now?
The Time to Act is Now

With increasing consumer trust in ethical practices and recent tax incentives for philanthropy, there’s no better time
  to embrace the PhilCo model. Businesses that act now gain a competitive edge, build customer loyalty, and contribute
  to society in a meaningful way. Make the shift today.
