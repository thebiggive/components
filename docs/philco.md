# Components for Philco site

The following components are expected to be used in the Philco website, and will need re-themeing to fit the design
there. Those that we have developed are marked with [✓]

- [biggive-button](../src/components/biggive-button/readme.md) [✓]
- [biggive-quote](../src/components/biggive-quote/readme.md) [✓]
- [biggive-basic-card](../src/components/biggive-basic-card/readme.md) [ ]
- [biggive-text-input](../src/components/biggive-text-input/readme.md) [✓]

There are also some new components built or required specifically for philco:

- [philco-main-menu](../src/components/philco-main-menu/readme.md) [✓]
- [philco-footer](../src/components/philco-footer/readme.md) [✓]

And others still to build include:
- Checkbox (but will likely be built in WP rather than here)
