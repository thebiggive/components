/**
 * Used to manually set the base path where assets can be found.
 * If the script is used as "module", it's recommended to use "import.meta.url",
 * such as "setAssetPath(import.meta.url)". Other options include
 * "setAssetPath(document.currentScript.src)", or using a bundler's replace plugin to
 * dynamically set the path at build time, such as "setAssetPath(process.env.ASSET_PATH)".
 * But do note that this configuration depends on how your script is bundled, or lack of
 * bundling, and where your assets can be loaded from. Additionally custom bundling
 * will have to ensure the static assets are copied to its build directory.
