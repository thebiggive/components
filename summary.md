# Heading Banner Component Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

1. **Created a new Stencil component `biggive-heading-banner`**:
   - Implemented in `/components/src/components/biggive-heading-banner/`
   - Preserves all functionality of the original Angular component
   - Uses Shadow DOM for style encapsulation

2. **Updated the Angular component to delegate to the Stencil component**:
   - Modified the template to use the Stencil component
   - Added CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA to allow using the custom element
   - Preserved image optimization functionality

3. **Created a WordPress block for the component**:
   - Implemented in `/wordpress/wp-content/themes/biggive/template-parts/blocks/heading-banner.php`
   - Uses Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for content management
   - Renders the same Stencil component with appropriate properties

## Architecture Recommendations

1. **Component Library Strategy**:
   - The approach of moving components to a shared Stencil library is excellent for code reuse
   - Consider implementing more components this way for consistent design across platforms

2. **Image Optimization**:
   - Consider implementing a similar image optimization service for WordPress
   - Alternatively, add image optimization capabilities to the Stencil component itself

3. **Documentation and Testing**:
   - Add Storybook stories and unit tests for the component
   - Document usage in both Angular and WordPress contexts

4. **Maintenance Strategy**:
   - When updating, make changes to the Stencil version first
   - Ensure changes are compatible with both Angular and WordPress implementations
   - Consider implementing a versioning strategy for the component library

This architecture provides a solid foundation for sharing UI components between Angular and WordPress, ensuring consistent design and behavior across platforms while reducing duplication of effort.
